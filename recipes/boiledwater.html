            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>water</li>
                <li>salt (optional)</li>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><p>Open your cupboard or wherever it is you store your cookware, and find a pot of appropriate size</p></li>
              <li>
                <p>Place your pot in the sink under the tap.
                    If you have never used a sink before, it is the large depression in your counter top. (If you live with someone else, they may have filled it with dirty dishes; in this case, wash them or simply remove them from the sink and place them in the oven â€” someone else will eventually discover them there and wash them.).</p></li>
                 <li><p>Turn the cold-water knob to the "on" position. Fill stockpot to within a couple inches of the rim.</p></li>
                 <li><p>Lift stockpot from sink and transfer to stove. </p></li>
                 <li><p>Find knob on stove that corresponds to the "burner" you have placed your pot on.</p> </li>
                 <li><p>Turn knob to "High" and wait until water boils. Depending on strength of your stove and amount of water, the boiling time may vary. 
                    <br>Note: DO NOT WATCH THE POT; it will never boil in the event that you do.</p></li>
                <li><p>Placing a lid on the pot will help it boil faster, with the additional benefit of blocking water from your line of sight, which, as stated above, inhibits the boiling process.</p></li>
                <li><p>Depending on water application, you may want to salt the water. Do this after the water has come to a boil.</p></li>
                <li><p>Boiled water may be used for any number of applications. Serve hot but do not drink.</p></li>
